	<h1><center>Danger of Ethylene Glycol </center></h1>
	<li class="abu2">Ethylene glycol is the primary ingredient in antifreeze, making up 95 to 97% of the product.  A tiny amount of antifreeze is enough to cause pets to become dangerously ill. Only a teaspoon or two will poison a cat, while three tablespoons will poison a fifteen pound dog. A dog only needs to ingest 2 to 3 milliliters of ethylene glycol per pound of body weight to get a lethal dose of the toxin; cats only need to ingest 0.64 milliliters for the same effect.</li>
