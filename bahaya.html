	<title>DANGER OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL</title>

 <ul>

 	<h1>DANGER OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL</h1>
 	<BIG>Ethylene glycol has a sweet taste and is often accidentally or intentionally ingested.</BIG>
 
 	<BIG>Ethylene glycol is chemically broken down in the body into toxic compounds.</BIG>
 	<BIG> Its toxic by products first affect the central nervous system (CNS), then the heart, and finally the kidneys. Ingestion of sufficient amounts can be fatal. </BIG>
 	<BIG>Ethylene glycol is odorless; odor does not provide any warning of inhalation exposure to hazardous concentrations.</BIG>
 	<p><big>Systemic ethylene glycol toxicity can occur through ingestion. Breathing ethylene glycol vapors may cause eye and respiratory tract irritation but is unlikely to cause systemic toxicity. Ethylene glycol is poorly absorbed through the skin so systemic toxicity is unlikely. Eye exposure may lead to local adverse health effects but is unlikely to result in systemic toxicity.</big></p>
 <h2>Personal Protective Equipment</h2>	
  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  <li><big>GENERAL INFORMATION: <p>First Responders should use a NIOSH-certified Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) with a Level A protective suit when entering an area with an unknown contaminant or when entering an area where the concentration of the contaminant is unknown. Level A protection should be used until monitoring results confirm the contaminant and the concentration of the contaminant.</p> </big></li>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
  <li><big>NOTE: <p>Safe use of protective clothing and equipment requires specific skills developed through training and experience.</p></big></li>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
 <li><big>LEVEL A: (RED ZONE): <p>Select when the greatest level of skin, respiratory, and eye protection is required. This is the maximum protection for workers in danger of exposure to unknown chemical hazards or levels above the IDLH or greater than the AEGL-2.
A NIOSH-certified CBRN full-face-piece SCBA operated in a pressure-demand mode or a pressure-demand supplied air hose respirator with an auxiliary escape bottle.
A Totally-Encapsulating Chemical Protective (TECP) suit that provides protection against CBRN agents.
Chemical-resistant gloves (outer).
Chemical-resistant gloves (inner).
Chemical-resistant boots with a steel toe and shank.
Coveralls, long underwear, and a hard hat worn under the TECP suit are optional items.</p></big></li>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <li><big>LEVEL B: (RED ZONE):<p>Select when the highest level of respiratory protection is necessary but a lesser level of skin protection is required. This is the minimum protection for workers in danger of exposure to unknown chemical hazards or levels above the IDLH or greater than AEGL-2. It differs from Level A in that it incorporates a non-encapsulating, splash-protective, chemical-resistant splash suit that provides Level A protection against liquids but is not airtight.
A NIOSH-certified CBRN full-face-piece SCBA operated in a pressure-demand mode or a pressure-demand supplied air hose respirator with an auxiliary escape bottle.
A hooded chemical-resistant suit that provides protection against CBRN agents.
Chemical-resistant gloves (outer).
Chemical-resistant gloves (inner).
Chemical-resistant boots with a steel toe and shank.
Coveralls, long underwear, a hard hat worn under the chemical-resistant suit, and chemical-resistant disposable boot-covers worn over the chemical-resistant suit are optional items.</p> </big></li>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  <li><big>LEVEL C: (YELLOW ZONE): <p>Select when the contaminant and concentration of the contaminant are known and the respiratory protection criteria factors for using Air Purifying Respirators (APR) or Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR) are met. This level is appropriate when decontaminating patient/victims.
A NIOSH-certified CBRN tight-fitting APR with a canister-type gas mask or CBRN PAPR for air levels greater than AEGL-2.
A NIOSH-certified CBRN PAPR with a loose-fitting face-piece, hood, or helmet and a filter or a combination organic vapor, acid gas, and particulate cartridge/filter combination or a continuous flow respirator for air levels greater than AEGL-1.
A hooded chemical-resistant suit that provides protection against CBRN agents.
Chemical-resistant gloves (outer).
Chemical-resistant gloves (inner).
Chemical-resistant boots with a steel toe and shank.
Escape mask, face shield, coveralls, long underwear, a hard hat worn under the chemical-resistant suit, and chemical-resistant disposable boot-covers worn over the chemical-resistant suit are optional items.
LEVEL D: (GREEN ZONE): Select when the contaminant and concentration of the contaminant are known and the concentration is below the appropriate occupational exposure limit or less than AEGL-1 for the stated duration times.
Limited to coveralls or other work clothes, boots, and gloves.</p></big></li>
