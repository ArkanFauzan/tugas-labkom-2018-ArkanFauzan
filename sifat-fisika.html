	<h1>Physical Properties Of Ethylene Glycol</h1>
	<p>Ethylene glycol is a clear, sweet, slightly viscous liquid that boils at 198 °C (388.4 °F). Its most common use is as an automotive antifreeze. A 1:1 solution of ethylene glycol and water boils at 129 °C (264.2 °F) and freezes at −37 °C (−34.6 °F), serving as an excellent coolant in automotive radiators. Ethylene glycol is highly poisonous; animals or humans that drink the solution become very ill and may die.</p>
